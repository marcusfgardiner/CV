I am an enthusiastic Junior Developer with the business acumen, communication and delivery skills of an experienced Management Consultant. I pride myself on software craftsmanship and I am driven by learning.

Following 4 years as a Strategy & Operations Consultant at Deloitte, I won the Makers Academy & ETC Coding Competition. In the intensive 16 week bootcamp that followed, I loved coding in an environment where the focus was honing a best-practice approach to development.

I want to work as part of a dynamic team to learn, solve difficult challenges and build cutting-edge digital technology.

#### Relationships and teamwork

The brightest points of my working day are the breakthrough moments I have in relationships and teams. The central theme for my personal growth has been the mentors I have had and the people I have been lucky enough to mentor: they have helped me think differently, perform as my best self and ultimately be myself.

**Key achievement:** I took great pride in learning and then demystifying technical skills for my colleagues and clients at Deloitte. In 2017, I led the development and delivery of a brand new Strategy & Operations Analytics Bootcamp for over 200 consultants.
