I am an enthusiastic Developer with the business acumen, communication and delivery skills of an experienced Management Consultant. I believe software development is a craft to hone and I am driven by learning.

Following 4 years as a Strategy & Operations Consultant at Deloitte, I begun to teach myself how to code and won the Makers Academy & ETC Coding Competition. In the intensive 16 week bootcamp that followed, I loved coding in an environment where the focus was developing a best-practice approach.

I want to work as part of a dynamic team to learn rapidly, solve difficult challenges and build cutting-edge digital technology.
